# SDET Front-End Test

We want you to test the Philae lander game on the BBC website using a series of automated tests.  

Link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-29746430
 
The game runs in an iFrame, so to make it easier, you can initially test against the game directly here:

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2014/newsspec_8368_b/content/english/index.html?v=0.1.872&onbbcdomain=true


## These are the requirements for you

1) Write a test that confirms that a specific speed and height result in a perfect landing.   

2) Write a series of tests for each unique combination of height and speed - testing that the result is as expected each time (touchdown, crash, etc.)

3) (Optional, extra credits :) ) Test the site through the main BBC website, overcoming any security issues regarding interaction with content in an iFrame. Use https://www.bbc.co.uk/ as the entry point such that navigation to the page above is included in your tests.


## Some additional instructions

1) Use a professional approach of planning, design, implementation. Document your approach (README please), and decide yourself in how to show that your solution does what it should.
  
2) There is no right or wrong here, but be prepared to comment on and argue for the choices that you have made.

3) Treat this like an agile project and set yourself a timeframe to deliver this task and stick to it. The most important aspect is to deliver something in you version 1 that works and can be extended

4) You can use any testing platform/language you wish. We are looking for high-quality, readable, and reliable code.
